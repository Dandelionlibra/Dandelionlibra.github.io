   「世有靈獸，貌似黑貓，眸若金燈，通人性，能報恩於人，或助其康健，或圓其遺願，名曰『夜行使』。」\n\n林致遠放下書，轉頭望向書桌下正打盹的阿墨。那雙金色的眼睛，正靜靜望著他，彷彿什麼都明白。\n命運交錯\n\n這年冬天，書店迎來了一位特殊的客人。女孩名叫蘇曉，是一位文學研究生，對古籍情有獨鍾。她總在下午三點來，點一杯菊花茶，在書架間翻閱那些無人問津的老書。\n######################\nOutput:",

   「世有靈獸，貌似黑貓，眸若金燈，通人性，能報恩於人，或助其康健，或圓其遺願，名曰『夜行使』。」\\n\\n林致遠放下書，轉頭望向書桌下正打盹的阿墨。那雙金色的眼睛，正靜靜望著他，彷彿什麼都明白。\\n命運交錯\\n\\n這年冬天，書店迎來了一位特殊的客人。女孩名叫蘇曉，是一位文學研究生，對古籍情有獨鍾。她總在下午三點來，點一杯菊花茶，在書架間翻閱那些無人問津的老書。\\n######################\\nOutput:\"},
